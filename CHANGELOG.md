# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to Hubble. Entries are written as work lands
(see the `changelog` skill), then harvested into the desktop release notes.

Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Add table support. Markdown tables now render as expected, and you can create new tables using `/table`. There are still editing features left to add, like adding and removing rows. Track progress on GitHub: [#99](https://github.com/bholmesdev/hubble.md/issues/99)
- Create HTML Apps from the new file dropdown, folder menus, and the File menu
- Empty HTML App files show a setup screen with the skill install command and a ready-to-copy agent prompt, with a check once the skills are detected

### Changed
- Keyboard shortcut hints now show the correct keys on Windows and Linux (Ctrl/Alt instead of macOS symbols)
- More buttons and menus now show their keyboard shortcut, including the format and slash command menus
- The HTML Apps popup in new workspaces is gone; setup now happens when you create an HTML App

### Fixed
- Desktop saves no longer drop trailing content in notes with multibyte characters
- Relative Markdown file links now open the linked file instead of showing an invalid URL error
